# House-Price-Prediction: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

Machine learning and data science tasks frequently include predicting house prices. We will investigate how to resolve the issue in this circumstance utilising the two well-liked regression algorithms, linear regression and random forest regression.

Linear Regression: The frequently used regression procedure known as "linear regression" makes the assumption that the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (home price) have a linear relationship. 
Here is how to forecast property prices using linear regression: 

a. Load the dataset: The dataset including features (such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location) and the accompanying housing pricing should first be loaded.

b. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features if necessary.

c. Split the dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the Linear Regression model, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

d. Train the model: Fit the Linear Regression model to the training data. The model will estimate the coefficients for each feature, representing the relationship between the features and the house prices.

e. Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict house prices for the test data points.

f. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the Linear Regression model using evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared value. These metrics measure how well the model predicts house prices compared to the actual prices.

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning system called Random Forest mixes various decision trees to produce predictions. It is renowned for its capacity to identify intricate connections between characteristics and the desired variable. 
The Random Forest Regressor can be used to anticipate home prices in the following ways:

a. Load the dataset: Similarly, load the dataset containing features and corresponding house prices.

b. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the features if necessary.

c. Split the dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

d. Train the model: Fit the Random Forest Regressor to the training data. The algorithm will build a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data and a random subset of features.

e. Make predictions: Use the trained Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices for the test data points.

f. Evaluate the model: Assess the performance of the Random Forest Regressor using evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R-squared value.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both linear regression and random forest regression. While Random Forest Regressor can detect intricate nonlinear associations, Linear Regression is a straightforward and understandable approach. It is frequently advised to test several models and evaluate their results before selecting the best one for a particular dataset.
